## Student Panel Language Switching

**How it works:**
1. Student logs in and opens a course
2. Selects target language from dropdown
3. Backend checks if dubbed version exists (cached)
4. If cached: Returns instantly
5. If not cached: Starts dubbing process, shows progress
6. Once complete: Dubbed content is playable

## Summary

✅ **All Integration Tests PASSED**

**Ready for Production Testing:**
- ML service is properly connected
- Dubbing workflow is functional
- Caching mechanism works correctly
- Both video and audio processing verified

**Recommendation:**
System is ready for user testing. All core functionality is operational.
